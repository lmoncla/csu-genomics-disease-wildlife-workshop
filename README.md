# csu-infectious-disease-wildlife-course
In June 2023, I taught 2 lectures and labs for a [workshop on the Genomics of Disease in Wildlife.](https://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu/) This was a great workshop, run and organized by Jill Pecan-Slattery and taught by a really fantastic group of PIs. My lectures covered a brief introduction to phylodynamics, BEAST, and Nextstrain. These materials, along with all the course materials and the workshop schedule are available from the [course github page.](https://github.com/gdw-workshop/2023_GDW_Workshop) However, I'm also making my materials available here. The tutorials are meant to be self-guided, and include screenshots to help you work through setting up and interpreting BEAST and Nextstrain analyses. Enjoy!
